# AI-and-Cybersecurity-applications

This Repository contains Cybersecurity related applications approaching through machine learning.

These are the following codes which are there in the repository now.

1) Phising detection using Logistic Regression
2) Phising detection using Linear Regression
3) Phising detection using SVM
4) Phising detection using Perceptron

Data Source:
Phising data set is taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites here.

Approach:
The above data set is approached through above machine learning algorithms

Best one:
For this lab I have observed SVM has the best approach in detecting phising.
